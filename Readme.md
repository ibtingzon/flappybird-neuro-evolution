# Flappybird - Neuro-evolution
Flappy bird trained using neural networks and genetic algorithm. 
* Flappybird learns after around 10-20 generations
* Genetic algorithm implements elitism to preserve the best solutions
* Used only 2 inputs:
	* Horizontal distance from next pipe
	* Vertical Distance from the top of the next lower pipe
